## The Best Classifier: Supervised Machine learning Classification
This project is aimed at demonstrating some supervised machine learning classification algorithms using Python in Jupyter notebooks. The data is classified using the four algorithms and accuracy scores are compared. The Notebook Contain data preprocessing, Data visualization, data transformation, feature selection, and normalization. During the Modelling process the algorithms involved are:

- K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
  
You may proceed to the notebook, Enjoy...

Thank you.
